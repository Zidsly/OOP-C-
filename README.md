# Zen Car Rental System Using C++

## Overview
**Zen Car Rental System** is a simple program built using C++ with an object-oriented programming (OOP) approach. This system is designed to simplify the process of renting cars by allowing customers to access the service digitally, without requiring face-to-face interaction. The program includes a user-friendly menu where customers can rent cars quickly and efficiently.

This project demonstrates how technology and programming can be used to digitize public services, ensuring businesses remain competitive and sustainable in a rapidly changing, internet-connected world. Inspired by the shift to online services during the COVID-19 pandemic, this system showcases a solution to modernize car rental services.
